            <h2>Why Monte Carlo Simulation Matters for Retirement Planning</h2>
            <p>Traditional retirement calculators give you a single number based on average returns: "If your portfolio grows at 7% per year, you'll have $X at retirement." But real markets don't work that way.</p>
            
            <p>Markets have bear markets, bull markets, recessions, and booms. The <strong>sequence</strong> of these returns matters enormously - retiring right before a crash produces very different outcomes than retiring at a market peak.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Monte Carlo simulation</strong> runs your retirement plan through thousands of possible market scenarios to show you the full range of outcomes - from best case to worst case. This reveals critical risks that traditional calculators completely miss.</p>
            
            <p>Below are two real examples showing how Monte Carlo analysis provides a more honest picture than simple linear projections:</p>

        <!-- Case Study 1: Nelson -->
        <article class="case-study" id="nelson">
            <h2>Case Study: Nelson & Family – "Can We Retire at 55?"</h2>
            
            <div class="case-section">
                <h3>📋 Profile</h3>
                <p>Nelson Tan (55), married, accounting professional in Singapore.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-section">
                <h3>💰 Assets & Income</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Home:</strong> Fully-owned HDB flat (primary residence).</li>
                    <li><strong>Investment Property:</strong> A partially-paid private shoebox apartment. Provides $18,000/year after-tax income, growing with inflation (2.5% p.a.).</li>
                    <li><strong>Pension:</strong> CPF Life set aside. Will pay $12,000/year starting at age 65.</li>
                    <li><strong>Portfolio:</strong> A $450,000 nest egg in a balanced portfolio (50% Global Equities / 50% Local Bonds).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="case-section">
                <h3>❓ The Big Question</h3>
                <p class="highlight">Can Nelson retire now with annual living expenses of $48,000 ($4,000 per month)?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-section">
                <h3>📊 The Traditional Answer (Linear Forecast)</h3>
                <p>Using steady, risk-free returns, their assets would fund a comfortable retirement until Nelson turns 85. (See the 'Expected Returns' tab).</p>
                <div class="note-box">
                    <p><strong>This looks great on paper:</strong> A smooth, reassuring line showing money lasting 30 years. Most retirement calculators stop here.</p>
                </div>

            <div class="case-section">
                <h3>🎲 The RetireSim Reality (Probabilistic Forecast)</h3>
                <p>When we model thousands of realistic market scenarios with ups and downs, a crucial risk emerges.</p>

                    <div class="result-item warning">
                        <strong>⚠️ Critical Finding</strong>
                        <p><strong>There is a 20% chance the portfolio could be exhausted up to 9 years earlier.</strong></p>
                        <p class="explanation">This means in 1 out of 5 possible market scenarios, Nelson could run out of money by age 76 instead of 85 - a significant risk that linear forecasts completely miss.</p>

                </div>

                <p><strong>What drives this risk?</strong> The biggest danger is sequence-of-returns risk - if a major market crash occurs in the first 5-10 years of retirement, Nelson would be forced to sell investments at depressed prices to cover living expenses, permanently reducing his portfolio's ability to recover.</p>

            <div class="case-section">
                <h3>📋 Profile</h3>
                <p>Emma Clark (33), single, digital nomad and FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) enthusiast.</p>
                <p>She works remotely as a freelance software developer, leveraging geo-arbitrage to minimize expenses while traveling through Southeast Asia and Europe.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-section">
                <h3>🎯 The Aggressive Plan</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Current Portfolio:</strong> $350,000 in a globally diversified, equity-heavy portfolio (90% Global Equities / 10% Bonds).</li>
                    <li><strong>Savings Rate:</strong> Puts aside $35,000 annually from her high freelance income.</li>
                    <li><strong>FIRE Target:</strong> Aims to accumulate a $1.5 million portfolio by age 45 (12 years from now) to fund a permanently sustainable retirement.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="case-section">
                <h3>❓ The Core Question</h3>
                <p class="highlight">Can her current savings rate and aggressive investment strategy realistically hit her $1.5M target in 12 years? What is the probability of success, and what are the key risks?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-section">
                <h3>📊 The Linear Forecast (Naive Optimism)</h3>
                <p>Assuming a steady, above-average annual return (e.g., 8%), her portfolio would surpass the $1.5M target just before age 45. This simple projection makes her goal seem easily within reach. (See the 'Expected Returns' tab).</p>
                <div class="note-box">
                    <p><strong>This is what typical FIRE calculators show:</strong> A smooth upward curve hitting your target right on schedule. But is it realistic?</p>

            <div class="case-section">
                <h3>🎲 The RetireSim Reality (Market Volatility)</h3>
                <p>When we stress-test her plan against thousands of realistic market scenarios—including potential bear markets, sequence of returns risk, and variable inflation during her critical savings years—the picture becomes more nuanced.</p>
                
                <div class="results-box">
                    <div class="result-item warning">
                        <strong>⚠️ Sobering Reality</strong>
                        <p><strong>Analysis shows only a 50% probability of reaching her goal by 45.</strong></p>
                        <p class="explanation">It's a coin flip - half of market scenarios get her to $1.5M on time, half don't.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="result-item danger">
                        <strong>❌ Worst Case Scenarios</strong>
                        <p><strong>In 10% of market scenarios, she could fall short by $600,000 or more.</strong></p>
                        <p class="explanation">A major bear market during her late 30s or early 40s could significantly delay her FIRE date, potentially by 5-7 years.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                </div>

                <p><strong>Why such high variance?</strong> Emma's aggressive 90/10 allocation amplifies both gains AND losses. During accumulation years, market crashes hurt, but she can dollar-cost-average and buy the dip. However, a prolonged bear market in her early 40s - when her portfolio is largest - could substantially delay reaching her target.</p>
